a. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

The things I would have done differently during the planning stages of my project to make execution easier is break down the tasks more into shorter "sprints".

c.What would you add to or change about your website if given more time ?

I would like to add more pages to the "View Accomplishment" buttons and I wouldve like to add a page to show what the "Adopt" button would have looked like.
